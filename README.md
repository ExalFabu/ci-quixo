## Description
The game Quixo is a Tic-Tac-Toe variant, played on a five-by-five board of cubes with two players or teams. On a player's turn, they select a blank cube or a cube with their symbol on it that is at the edge of the board. If a blank cube was selected, the cube is turned to be the player's symbol (either an X or O). The game ends when one player gets five in a row.
